### Final Project: Backbone App
######[Deadline: 28.11.2013]

WP7 backbone app.

My company is creating its first mobile app.
Initially it is required to build a backbone app where to add different features.
That backbone app needs to handle localization, tombstoning and other main requirements for this assigment.

In reality, it will use our own REST API to reach data, but because it is still in development, I will user MongoHQ as database-as-service, to simulate database access.

Grading details:
* Localization
* M-V-MV architecture
* Tombstoning handling
* Live tile
* Application bar
* Metro UI focus on UX
  * Splash screen support
  * Tappable support
  * Default themes support
  * Use of Silverlight toolkit
  * Orientation support
  * Context menu support
  * Use of open source components
* Cloud service RESTful API support
  * MongoHQ
